        <p>From Wikipedia
(<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/E-Prime">link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>E-Prime (short for English-Prime, sometimes denoted Eâ€²) is a version
of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb to be.
E-Prime does not allow conjugations of to be (am, are, is, was, were,
be, been, being), archaic forms (e.g. art, wast, wert), or
contractions (&rsquo;s, &rsquo;m, &rsquo;re).</p>

<p>Some scholars advocate using E-Prime as a device to clarify thinking
and strengthen writing. For example, the sentence &ldquo;the film was good&rdquo;
could translate into E-Prime as &ldquo;I liked the film&rdquo; or as &ldquo;the film
made me laugh&rdquo;. The E-Prime versions communicate the speaker&rsquo;s
experience rather than judgment, making it harder for the writer or
reader to confuse opinion with fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exercise helped me strengthen this sentence, I think.</p>
