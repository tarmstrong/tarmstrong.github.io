        <p>The sheer humility, honesty, and deliberate action these two people took
to fight a problem they saw in the world is inspiring. They listened to
people, <em>really</em> listened to people, and didn&rsquo;t shy away from the faults
in their approach. This is the most practical guide for how to get fresh
blood into programming that I&rsquo;ve seen yet.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been programming for that long. Three years ago, when I was in
my first year of school, I really wanted to learn how to program. At
that point, I had considered going to Montreal Python meetups, but I was
too shy and didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d know what was going on, or that I wouldn&rsquo;t
fit in. So when people make an effort to reach shy outsiders, especially
people who are minorities in the development community who may feel even
more shy than I did for that reason, it makes me really happy.</p>

<p>[On advertising workshops:] Make the tone very clear. We&rsquo;re about
being inclusive and growing communities, and not about being
exclusive. So if you&rsquo;re just a little bit careful about your language
there, I think you&rsquo;ll find that everyone is thrilled to support you in
this. Men, women, everyone. â€” Jessica McKellar</p>
