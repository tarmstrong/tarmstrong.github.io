<title>Talk Notes: The Two Solitudes for Hackers</title>
<h1>Talk Notes: The Two Solitudes for Hackers</h1>
<h2>by <a href="http://tavi.sh/">Tavish Armstrong</a> / <code>tavisharmstrong at gmail dot com</code> / <code>@tavarm</code> </h2>

<p>These are notes on a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/226/">talk</a> I gave at PyCon 2014.
I hope this is a useful reference for anyone who saw the talk and wants to learn more about what I spoke about.
</p>

<p>If you are interested in what I spoke about in this talk, please, please,
get in touch via email. A lot of people mentioned afterwards that they'd be
interested in a mailing list or something similar. My hope is that we can gain
momentum by working on this together and motivating each other.</p>

  <p>The slides are not exactly useful as a reference, but some people like them as a way to jog their memory. They are available <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014/software-engineering-for-hackers-bridging-the-two-solitudes-by-tavish-armstrong">here</a> if you are one of those people!</p>
