<p>I began my search for code smells by ranking the files by the number of commits in the git log that touched each file (see Figure 1.) The most committed-to file is also one of the largest at 740 lines of code --- <code>Phergie/Driver/Streams.php</code>, which contains the <code>Phergie_Driver_Streams</code> class. Ostensibly, this class is for handling the TCP connection to the IRC server. I noticed two things immediately:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>Phergie_Driver_Streams</code> is the sole child class of <code>Phergie_Driver_Abstract</code>. This is over-generalization; there doesn't appear to be any reason to leave the code open for UDP-based IRC bots.</li>
<li><code>Phergie_Driver_Streams</code> is not only responsible for handling the connection to the server; it is also responsible for parsing and formatting IRC commands. The class is so large because it contains methods pertaining to both responsibilities, and methods that are (arguably) too large because they perform both duties as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1), the obvious solution is to flatten the hierarchy and use only the <code>Streams</code> class. For 2), my proposed solution is (see the provided UML diagrams):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Move the parsing logic from <code>getEvent()</code> to its own method called <code>parseEvent()</code></li>
<li>Move the <code>parseEvent()</code> method to a new class called <code>Phergie_IRC_Command_Handler</code>.</li>
<li>Move the formatting logic from <code>send()</code> to its own method called <code>formatCommand()</code>.</li>
<li>Move the <code>formatCommand()</code> method and all methods starting with <code>do</code> to <code>Phergie_IRC_Command_Handler</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>My best estimate is that this would split the class into two files with lengths of approximately 400 lines of code. This is closer to the mean (227 LOC) and in my opinion much more manageable and understandable --- each class has more clearly defined responsibility.</p>
