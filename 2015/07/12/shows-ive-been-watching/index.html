        <p>Earlier this year I learned to knit. Part of the appeal for me is that it&rsquo;s very easy to sit down, knit some stitches, and make progress. It&rsquo;s possible to screw up so badly you have to start over, but for the most part it&rsquo;s difficult to take large steps backward. Unlike with programming, it&rsquo;s hard to knit a scarf so badly it causes active harm to you and the people around you. If you&rsquo;re patient, you&rsquo;ll eventually have a scarf or a sweater, and no matter how many stiches you accidentally added in the wrong places, you still have something that represents a tonne of work to be proud of. Also you are now warmer than you were before, which is kind of cool.</p>

<p>One nice thing about knitting is that you can do it while you watch television. Some shows I&rsquo;ve been watching lately:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The West Wing</em></li>
<li><em>Adventure Time</em>, which is hilarious and cuter than a show has any right to be.</li>
<li><em>Bomb Girls</em>, which follows the stories of the workers of a Toronto munitions factory during WWII. Like <em>The Bletchley Circle</em>, it focuses on parts of the war effort that are not usually explored in war movies, viz., the home front. It also spends some time on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-Canadian_internment">darker parts of Canadian history</a>, which I appreciate.</li>
<li><em>Sense8</em>, the new Netflix show from The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski. <a href="https://twitter.com/aphyr/status/617943823243546625">This show is great</a>. And hey, some of it takes place in SF which is kind of neat.</li>
</ul>

<p>(This fluff post is brought to you by a few weeks of travel and strep throat. Pro-tip: don&rsquo;t get strep throat.)</p>
