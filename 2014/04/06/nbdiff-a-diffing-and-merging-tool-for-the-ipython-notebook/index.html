        <p>Final-year engineering students at many universities have to complete a &ldquo;Capstone&rdquo; project that gives them a chance to apply everything they learned throughout school to a practical, hands-on group project. My team just finished ours &ndash; a project called <a href="http://nbdiff.org">NBDiff</a> &ndash; and I&rsquo;m happy to report that it was a success.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve spoken to me in the last couple years, you&rsquo;ve probably heard me ramble about the IPython Notebook, a rich web-based environment for scientific computing. Well, that project is wonderful, but there&rsquo;s a catch with working on notebook files: the file format is a giant JSON blob and makes version control tricky. If you use <code>git diff</code>, it can be hard to understand what you&rsquo;ve actually changed, and if you need to resolve a merge conflict? Fasten your seatbelt.</p>

<p>NBDiff takes a stab at making these tasks easier. It presents diffs in a two-pane format and shows you deleted/added cells how you originally saw them in the notebook: if an image was changed, you see the image instead of a 10000-line diff of a base64 encoded PNG file. When resolving merge conflicts, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about mangling the JSON by hand &ndash; you just drag and drop changes into the final version and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;.</p>

<p>As far as school projects go, this one was very satisfying. We have 50 GitHub stars and several hundred downloads already; I can actually use it to solve problems <em>right now</em>; and the IPython folks are interested in seeing it maintained beyond Capstone. Considering many school projects &ndash; even Capstone projects &ndash; never see the light of day, let alone continued maintenance, I&rsquo;m really happy about this.</p>
