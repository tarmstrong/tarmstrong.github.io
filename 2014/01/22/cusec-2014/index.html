        <h1>CUSEC 2014</h1>
        <h6>Wed 22 Jan 2014 13:16:00</h6>
        

<p>The 2014 edition of <a href="http://2014.cusec.net">the Canadian University Software Engineering Conference</a> was this past weekend and I thought I&rsquo;d write a short post about it.</p>

<p>Since I wasn&rsquo;t on the organizing board this year, I got to enjoy the conference in a much more relaxing fashion.
It was also my fifth CUSEC, so I&rsquo;ve figured out how this conference works and how to talk to people.
Having a lot of friends in the companies at the career fair helps; being friends with <a href="http://jvns.ca">one</a> of the speakers helps too.
But more importantly, I&rsquo;m just way older and more confident than my 19-year-old self.
I feel comfortable around nerds, and I&rsquo;m not totally lost in a technical conversation.
I&rsquo;ve grown just as much as CUSEC has grown.</p>

<h2 id="talks">Talks!</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about a few of the talks that really stood out to me.</p>

<p>Famous blogger <a href="http://jvns.ca">Julia Evans</a> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> gave a fun talk on hacking
on the kernel. Operating system kernels are a really neat part of computers
that I don&rsquo;t know much about, and Julia makes it seem easy and not scary at
all. She had a neat trick of hiding all the parts of a C program that aren&rsquo;t
relevant to understanding it on a high level. It&rsquo;s quite rare for someone to
take a very technically intimidating subject and make it seem within your
grasp.</p>

<p>Josh Matthews gave a <a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/cusec14/">talk</a> on developing
for Firefox: the kinds of projects Mozilla has that you can work on, how to
find a bug to work on, and what the patch process is like. I spent the last
summer looking at how open source projects do code review, so a lot of this
was obvious to me, but this is exactly the kind of talk that would have
completely blown my mind a couple years ago.</p>

<p>He went a few steps further and bravely walked the audience through a complete
Firefox patch, explaining the important parts of the code, and giving a brief
overview of the architecture along the way. Similarly to Julia&rsquo;s talk, it was a
very non-threatening introduction to an extremely intimidating topic.</p>

<p>Nadim Kobeissi spoke about <a href="http://crypto.cat">CryptoCat</a>, a controvertial
encrypted chat service that&rsquo;s been under a lot of fire since it started for
horrible <a href="http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php">bugs</a> and being developed by a 23
year old (ad-hominem attacks abound). I admit I have a soft spot for Nadim
because he is a recent Concordia graduate <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, but also because I think he&rsquo;s
solving a tough problem that needs solving if encryption is ever to become
popular &mdash; usability.</p>

<p>Nadim&rsquo;s talk wasn&rsquo;t technical in nature &mdash; it was more about the political
side of things. He shared insightful observations on the nature of the struggle
between hackers and the surveillance state. In essence, he argued that they
both feed off making the other look like an adversary to be defeated, but the
real solution lies in common understanding. That&rsquo;s no easy feat when your
adversaries are organizations like CSEC and the NSA who have had no serious
oversight.</p>

<p>I was honestly surprised to find Nadim very approachable, humble, and easy to
talk to. He gave me some good advice on learning more about computer security
and finding mentors.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to spoil <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Gary
Bernhardt</a>&rsquo;s talk &mdash;
you&rsquo;ll have to watch it when it comes out &mdash; but it was stylistically very
interesting to me. I love science fiction and informative, thought-provoking
technical talks. The marriage of both is something else entirely, and I liked it.</p>

<p><a href="http://nerd.kelseyinnis.com/">Kelsey Gilmore-Innis</a> gave a fun, bombastic
introduction to functional programming.  <a href="https://twitter.com/avibryant">Avi
Bryant</a> spoke about detecting fraud, but I
missed the first half of his talk because I was talking to someone in the
hallway and didn&rsquo;t realize it had started. Oops. I had a nice chat with him
later, though, which sort of made up for it.</p>

<h2 id="question-time">Question time</h2>

<p>This year I gave myself a challenge: to ask a question after every talk I saw.
With two exceptions, I managed to do this, and it went pretty well. I got a
little better at handling my nerves throughout the weekend and managed not to
say anything too stupid. Julia&rsquo;s encouragement &mdash; something along the
lines of &ldquo;everyone thinks you&rsquo;re dumb anyways&rdquo; &mdash; was very helpful.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I have good taste in questions. I might write a blog post on what I
think makes a good post-talk question at some point.</p>

<h2 id="conference-pro-tips">Conference pro-tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Volunteering is a good way to make friends.</li>
<li>Talk to younger students and say nice encouraging things to them. Don&rsquo;t act like a smartypants, even if you are. Lower the ladder instead of pulling it up behind you.</li>
<li>Have a <a href="http://aosabook.org">physical object</a> that you built that you can
show off to company recruiters. Hack together a bunch of LEDs and a
microcontroller and sew it into your backpack. Whatever.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t complain about talks you didn&rsquo;t like, unless the presenter said
something harmful. Life is too short for inadvertently making people feel bad
about things they like, and it makes you look like a jerk. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Get as much sleep as you can without being a hermit. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>CUSEC was fun and I recommend going.</p>
