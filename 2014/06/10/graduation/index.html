        <h1>Graduation</h1>
        <h6>Tue 10 Jun 2014 22:34:00</h6>
        <p>Six years ago I moved to Montreal for university. An undergraduate degree should not be treated as a race, but it starts to feel that way after six years. Today, I finally graduated.</p>

<p>It feels good. I can complain all day about the things I didn&rsquo;t like about university &ndash; there are all too many of them, and I like to complain &ndash; but I&rsquo;m happy enough with where I am professionally, personally, intellectually right now that I can overlook that and just be happy.</p>

<p>Onward!</p>
