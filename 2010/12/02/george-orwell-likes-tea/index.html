        <h1>George Orwell likes tea</h1>
        <h6>Thu 02 Dec 2010 18:51:00</h6>
        <p>I enjoyed this essay by George Orwell on tea:
<a href="http://www.booksatoz.com/witsend/tea/orwell.htm" title="George Orwell: A Nice Cup of Tea">link</a>.
He attacks the subject with as much force as anything he&rsquo;s written. What
struck me, in particular, was how much he enjoyed writing it. It&rsquo;s
obvious, even in his reserved tone. This is something Zinsser talks
about often, and I&rsquo;m noticing it often in the writers I enjoy reading,
speakers I enjoy listening to, and teachers I enjoy learning from.</p>

<p>Orwell seems to think milk is a necessary ingredient in a nice cup of
tea. I disagree, for the same reason he disagrees with people who like
sugar in their tea. It tarnishes the drink, and I can&rsquo;t imagine feeling
&ldquo;wiser, braver, or more optimistic&rdquo; after drinking a milky tea.</p>
