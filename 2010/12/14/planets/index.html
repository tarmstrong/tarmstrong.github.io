        <p>Three things you should know about the planets in our solar system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Venus is the only planet whose north pole points in the direction of
Earth&rsquo;s south pole. That means it rotates opposite to its revolution
around the sun. It does so very slowly &ndash; its day is 243 times as
long as ours.</li>
<li>Uranus is tilted almost horizontally &ndash; meaning that it is doing a
barrel roll in the direction of its orbit. (Its north pole is still
tilted slightly &ldquo;upward&rdquo;.)</li>
<li>A long time ago, Mercury was hit so hard that one side of it has a
dent in it and the other side is a crumpled mess. The crumpled area
is referred to as Weird Terrain because it looks weird.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just the planets. Did you know that there&rsquo;s an asteroid
called Ida that <em>has a moon?</em></p>
