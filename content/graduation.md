Six years ago I moved to Montreal for university. An undergraduate degree should not be treated as a race, but it starts to feel that way after six years. Today, I finally graduated.

It feels good. I can complain all day about the things I didn't like about university -- there are all too many of them, and I like to complain -- but I'm happy enough with where I am professionally, personally, intellectually right now that I can overlook that and just be happy.

Onward!
