I've been messing about with [Overtone](https://github.com/overtone/overtone), a Clojure interface to [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/) to make interesting sounds as a way to combine my interests in programming and music. Overtone has been particularly enjoyable to use because it is (unlike SuperCollider) a programming language that has uses beyond sound synthesis, it is surprisingly easy to set up, and is not under active development (which, for the time being, means that it is stable. I'm looking on the bright side here.)

At some point I'll probably write down what I've learned about working with Overtone, but in the mean time, enjoy these sounds:
