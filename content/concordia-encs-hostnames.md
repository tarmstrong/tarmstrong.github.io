I've been doing a lot of my internetting in the lab at school, since my
laptop is in the shop. As I write this, I'm sitting at
`chipewyan.cs.concordia.ca`, and to my sides are `carrier` and
`cowichan`. My favourite so far is `absentee`. I used it while skipping
class the other day.

My new dream job: anything that lets me name computers.
