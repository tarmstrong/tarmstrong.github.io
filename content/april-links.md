[Hungry judges are
ruthless](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/03/29/1018033108). This
study finds that judges will not grant parole right before breaks or
meals, or when they are tired. Assuming some pre-lunch cases deserved a
favourable ruling (i.e. the judges were indeed being too heavy-handed
with their pre-lunch cases), this suggests that you should [avoid making
difficult decisions when you are
hungry](http://lesswrong.com/lw/58y/the_bias_you_didnt_expect/).

Charlie Stross
[predicts](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/04/you-probably-already-saw-this-.html)
that SpaceX could put a man on the moon by 2016 for \$1 Billion USD.

[Fake Science](http://fakescience.tumblr.com/) is so amusing that I
think some dopamines leaked out of my ear. (Thanks Helen!)

[Simon paints awesome
stuff](http://maycontaindragons.blogspot.com/2011/03/few-d-things-and-happy-birthday-to.html).

[Lachlan is saving Japan with his drone
friends](http://cultureisnotyourfriend.bandcamp.com/). His bass is like
an earthquake that helps Japan instead of destroying it.

[Concordia's undergraduate student union is
ridiculous](http://cjlo.com/news/concordia/your-concordia-and-action-disqualified-csu-elections).
After a decent party finally got voted in, the guy in charge of
elections, Oliver Cohen, decides both parties broke the rules, and thus
we need to have a another election. [The party that got voted in is not
allowed to run again for two
years.](http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2011/04/14/concordia-student-elecitons-chief-throws-out-vote-results/)

**Edit:** I forgot: if you're a software engineering student at
Concordia, you can now plan your class schedule with the
[WolfDragonScheduler](http://wolfdragon.org).
