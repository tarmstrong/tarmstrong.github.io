Here are a few pages on the internets that I've enjoyed recently:

* [A Distributed Systems Reading List](https://dancres.github.io/Pages/). I found the "Harvest and Yield" paper particularly helpful.
* [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/): opinionated guidelines for how to architect web services.
* [This is not a place of honour](http://www.wipp.energy.gov/picsprog/articles/wipp%20exhibit%20message%20to%2012,000%20a_d.htm): how to identify nuclear waste to future generations. (via mhoye)
* [We only hire the trendiest](http://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/) by Dan Luu, who is great.
* [Lessons learned from reading postmortems](http://danluu.com/postmortem-lessons/), also Dan Luu
* [How Complex Systems Fail](http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf), which is referenced in the above Dan Luu post
