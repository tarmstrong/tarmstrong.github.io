The sheer humility, honesty, and deliberate action these two people took
to fight a problem they saw in the world is inspiring. They listened to
people, *really* listened to people, and didn't shy away from the faults
in their approach. This is the most practical guide for how to get fresh
blood into programming that I've seen yet.

I haven't been programming for that long. Three years ago, when I was in
my first year of school, I really wanted to learn how to program. At
that point, I had considered going to Montreal Python meetups, but I was
too shy and didn't think I'd know what was going on, or that I wouldn't
fit in. So when people make an effort to reach shy outsiders, especially
people who are minorities in the development community who may feel even
more shy than I did for that reason, it makes me really happy.
