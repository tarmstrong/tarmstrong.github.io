The second volume of [The Architecture of Open Source
Applications](http://aosabook.org/) was just released thanks to the hard
work of [Amy Brown](http://www.amyrbrown.ca/index.html) and [Greg
Wilson](http://third-bit.com/). I had the privilege of helping copyedit
a few chapters of the book. Here's the blurb:

> Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and
> study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast,
> most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large
> programs well — usually programs they wrote themselves — and never
> study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one
> another’s mistakes rather than building on one another’s successes.
>
> This second volume of The Architecture of Open Source Applications
> aims to change that. In it, the authors of twenty-four open source
> applications explain how their software is structured, and why. What
> are each program's major components? How do they interact? And what
> did their builders learn during their development? In answering these
> questions, the contributors to this book provide unique insights into
> how they think.

Go buy it [at
Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/shop/amy-brown-and-greg-wilson/the-architecture-of-open-source-applications-volume-ii/paperback/product-20111008.html)
(ebook versions will also be available). It'll be available on Amazon at
some point, but Lulu is preferred, because a greater percentage of the
price goes towards royalties — which are going to Amnesty International.

<strike>A free online version will be up at some point next week.</strike> The online
version is available
