I just made a browser-based writing program that lets you write without
editing. Every time you hit return, it formats the paragraph you just
wrote. You can't go back and edit that paragraph. Editing is for people
who have completed stories.

Download it here:
[.zip](https://github.com/tarmstrong/write_pretty_story/zipball/master)
or
[.tar.gz](https://github.com/tarmstrong/write_pretty_story/tarball/master)
or [github.com](https://github.com/tarmstrong/write_pretty_story).

To run it, open the "pretty.html" file with your browser.

You can also try it
[here](http://tavisharmstrong.com/pretty/pretty.html).

**Update:** Now it saves your story locally, so when you refresh the
page it's still there.
