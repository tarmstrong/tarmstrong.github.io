## The basics

Hello! I'm Tavish.
I come from [Aurora, Ontario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Ontario), a town near Toronto.
Between 2008 and 2014 I lived in Montreal where I studied software engineering at Concordia University.
Since June 2014 I've lived in San Francisco where I work at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).
I've also lived briefly in Montauban, France and enjoy speaking broken french to anyone who will listen.

Don't be shy! Send me an email: tavisharmstrong at gmail dot com.
