I'm happy to announce that *The Performance of Open Source Applications* is
finally out. You can head over to [the AOSA website](http://aosabook.org) to
read it for free online and find links to places where you can purchase paper
or, soon, electronic copies.

If you do purchase it, the royalties go to Amnesty International.

If you want to know more about what the book is about, the
[introduction](http://aosabook.org/en/posa/introduction.html) is a good place
to start. The authors worked hard to share what they know and I learned a lot
from them; I hope you do too.
