In July I went to [D4D Boston
2011](http://boston2011.design4drupal.org/), a Drupal conference with a
focus on design. Even so, I was given the chance to do my talk on Drupal
7's Field API. To my surprise, I had an audience of around fifty to talk
to (or it at least felt like fifty).

The talk was based on blog post I wrote for Evolving Web about [Poutine
Maker](http://evolvingweb.ca/story/poutine-maker-introduction-field-api-drupal-7-part-1),
my custom Drupal field that lets users design crazy poutines. (You can
see the formatter in action
[here](http://poutinemaker.evolvingweb.ca/node/1).)

Overall, it was a fantastic experience. I'm a little shy at conferences,
so it was nice to meet people after who had seen my talk (even the guy
who kept calling me Tarvis).

Also, I'm totally going to [DrupalCon
London](http://london2011.drupal.org/) at the end of the month, which
I'm super jazzed about. Co-op jobs aren't supposed to be like this, but
I am *definitely not complaining*.

(By the way, if you want to work with me and the cool people I work
with, [Evolving Web is hiring](http://evolvingweb.ca/web-developer).)
