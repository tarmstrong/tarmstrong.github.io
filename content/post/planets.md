Three things you should know about the planets in our solar system:

1.  Venus is the only planet whose north pole points in the direction of
    Earth's south pole. That means it rotates opposite to its revolution
    around the sun. It does so very slowly -- its day is 243 times as
    long as ours.
2.  Uranus is tilted almost horizontally -- meaning that it is doing a
    barrel roll in the direction of its orbit. (Its north pole is still
    tilted slightly "upward".)
3.  A long time ago, Mercury was hit so hard that one side of it has a
    dent in it and the other side is a crumpled mess. The crumpled area
    is referred to as Weird Terrain because it looks weird.

And that's just the planets. Did you know that there's an asteroid
called Ida that *has a moon?*
