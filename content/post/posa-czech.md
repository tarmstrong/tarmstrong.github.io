Ladislav Lhotka at cz.nic (which, from what I understand, is the administrator of the .cz TLD) have published a translation of The Performance of Open Source Applications.

On their site you can read an [overview](https://www.nic.cz/page/3318/) of the book, [download links](https://knihy.nic.cz/) for the book and many others, or go straight for the [pdf version](https://knihy.nic.cz/files/edice/vykonnost_open_source_aplikaci.pdf).

I wish I could explain to you how cool it is that this book got translated by people I don't know on the internet without any contact from them. Creative Commons has always seemed like a great way to license your works, especially community efforts like POSA, but I don't often see it in action. Thank you Ladislav and friends!
