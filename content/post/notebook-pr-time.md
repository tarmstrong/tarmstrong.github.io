I wrote this a while ago, but I never linked to it from my blog. It's an
IPython Notebook that looks at how long it takes to review a pull request on
the [IPython](http://ipython.org) project.

[How long does it take to review a pull request on IPython?][nb]

I had fun writing it, and I'd like to see more of this from non-academics.
Hackers should be able to answer questions they have about a code base without
too much of a fuss. If I can find the time, I hope to make this a bit easier
with tools like [git2json](https://github.com/tarmstrong/git2json) &mdash; if
you'd like to help, I'd be grateful.
