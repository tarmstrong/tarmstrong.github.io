I built a simulator for the 16-bit timer in the Teensy++/Arduino
microcontroller in the hopes that people (e.g. fellow students of SOEN
422) might find it useful. Keep in mind that it's a work in progress and
has some bugs. [A Simple and Interactive Explanation of the Teensy's
16-bit timer (Timer1)](http://tavisharmstrong.com/timer1/).
