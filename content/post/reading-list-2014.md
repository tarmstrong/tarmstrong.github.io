I'd like to start writing on this blog again, but blogging takes a lot of work so I'm just going to list some of the fiction I read in 2014. I'm pretty sure I read more books than this, but these are the ones that I remember. They are in order from most to least favourite.

* *Use of Weapons* by Iain M. Banks
* *Ancillary Justice* by Ann Leckie
* *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K. Le Guin
* *A Deepness in the Sky* by Vernor Vinge
* *The Diamond Age* by Neal Stephenson
* *Player of Games* by Iain M. Banks
* *Excession* by Iain M. Banks
* *The Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss
* *The Windup Girl* by Paolo Bacigalupi

I also read some short fiction, but mostly can't remember it. This is what I do remember:

* [*The Lifecycle of Software Objects*](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2010/fiction_the_lifecycle_of_software_objects_by_ted_chiang) by Ted Chiang
* [*The Dust Assassin*](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/mcdonald_07_13_reprint/) by Ian McDonald
* [*Found*](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/macfarlane_08_13/) by Alex Dally MacFarlane
