From Wikipedia
([link](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/E-Prime)):

> E-Prime (short for English-Prime, sometimes denoted Eâ€²) is a version
> of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb to be.
> E-Prime does not allow conjugations of to be (am, are, is, was, were,
> be, been, being), archaic forms (e.g. art, wast, wert), or
> contractions ('s, 'm, 're).
>
> Some scholars advocate using E-Prime as a device to clarify thinking
> and strengthen writing. For example, the sentence "the film was good"
> could translate into E-Prime as "I liked the film" or as "the film
> made me laugh". The E-Prime versions communicate the speaker's
> experience rather than judgment, making it harder for the writer or
> reader to confuse opinion with fact.

This exercise helped me strengthen this sentence, I think.
