Earlier this week I read a neat post by Sarah Mei called [Why You Should Never
Use MongoDB][sarah]. Usually I would skip a blog post with that title, but
for some reason I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did.

I usually don't like titles like "why you should never use MongoDB" because the
author usually means "why you shouldn't use MongoDB if you are me and you are
using it in the specific way I am using it and you are in the specific business
that I work for." The author writes the snappy title because it looks good on
the Hacker News front page.

This isn't that kind of blog post, though, and she makes a compelling argument
that almost earns the title.

The title *should* be "Why *You* Should Never Use MongoDB". I'm being pedantic,
but I think the emphasis makes the point clearer. The post is making an
assumption about you, and that assumption is this: you are not as smart as she
is and if you are not as smart as she is, how can you hope to avoid the problem
she is describing? I am not as smart as she is, so I'm going to learn from her
mistake.

I'm an inexperienced software developer; a n00b. I haven't watched a large
software system go from infancy to smouldering ruins, nor have I watched design
decisions explode in my face nine months after making them. And how could I
have? I'm an undergraduate student and there aren't enough months of summer
jobs to string together to create those experiences.

Since I don't have many of these experiences of my own, I'm forced to use the
experiences of others. Let's call these [*prosthetic experiences*][aosa].
Brave, humble, smart folks like Sarah Mei, who can talk about the projects
they've seen crash and burn, are a boon; prosthetic experiences can help me
think about design tradeoffs in ways I wouldn't otherwise be able to without
dealing with those problems myself.  They help me develop paranoia in the right
places. Hopefully, it'll help me avoid boring mistakes and make more
interesting messes instead.

It's not fun to write about your mistakes. But I like it when you do.
