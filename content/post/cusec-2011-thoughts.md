CUSEC 2011 was my second time at the Canadian University Software
Engineering Conference. I felt less lost this time around, and it was a
good time. We saw some good talks, spoke to some cool people, and
skipped a lot of class.

Some highlights (my top 3):

-   [Drew Conway](http://www.drewconway.com/Drew_Conway/About.html)
    spoke about terrorism and drug networks, and how to visualize them
    using R (a language that specializes in visualizing data). The
    biggest takeaway was that domain expertise + code = awesome cool
    stuff.
-   [Sha Xin Wei](http://topologicalmedialab.net/xinwei/) spoke about
    the Topological Media Lab at Concordia. It was refreshing to see a
    talk like that at a tech conference; it wouldn't have been out of
    place at an art conference, but it also wasn't out of place at
    CUSEC. I like using code to do art, so it was a pretty inspiring
    talk.
-   Mike Shaver spoke about managing the Mozilla team. This guy is the
    one of the smartest people I've ever heard speak. He gave amazing
    answers to difficult questions, and answered even Linus
    Torvalds-grade flames with calm balance. You couldn't even get him
    to say incendiary stuff about Internet Explorer, which just blew my
    mind.   
   Mike began his talk by speaking briefly about how he is bi-polar.
    People don't understand problems of mental health very well, he
    says, and we need to be able to talk about it more openly. I admire
    his courage and ability to speak about it in front of a crowd of
    possibly immature students. Here is [Mike Shaver's
    blog](http://shaver.off.net/diary/).

Great conference. I look forward to a new year of hackery. I made the
same resolution last year, but my new resolution is to get something
impressive ready to demo at CUSEC next year.
