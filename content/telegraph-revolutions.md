From *1848: Year of Revolution* by Mike Rapport:

> The speed with which the wave of revolutions swept across Europe was
> due to the wonders of modern technology. In 1789 it took weeks for
> news â€“ carried, at its fastest, on horseback or under sail â€“ for the
> fall of the Bastille to be relayed across Central and Eastern Europe.
> In 1848, thanks to steamships and a nascent telegraph system, reports
> were being heard within days or even minutes.
