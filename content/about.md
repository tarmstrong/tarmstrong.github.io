I'm a software engineer from the Toronto area, now based in the San Francisco Bay Area. From 2008&endash;2014 I studied software engineering at Concordia University in Montreal. After that, I spent four years building financial infrastructure at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

In my free time, I enjoy skating (on the ice or on wheels), studying languages, fostering kittens, and travelling.
