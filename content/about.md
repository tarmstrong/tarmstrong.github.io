## Tell me about your life

I was born and raised in [Aurora, Ontario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Ontario), a town near Toronto. Between 2008 and 2014 I studied software engineering at Concordia University in Montreal. After graduating, I moved to San Francisco where I now build financial infrastructure at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

Professionally I am most interested in how [social factors impact software engineering][conway], [empirical evidence in software engineering][twosolitudes], [mentorship][mentorship], and [reliability][reliability].

In my spare time I also enjoy reading, writing fiction, and making music. I am not good at these things, but they are fun.

## What do you have to show for yourself?

When I was in university, I edited [The Performance of Open Source
Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html), a collection of case studies
on software performance. The goal was to do for performance what [The
Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)
did for architecture.

I maintain or co-maintain the following projects:

* [nbdiff](http://github.com/tarmstrong/nbdiff) ([on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nbdiff))
* [git2json](http://github.com/tarmstrong/git2json) ([on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/git2json))
* [pyadbc](http://github.com/tarmstrong/pyadbc) ([on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyadbc))
* [gitcoach](http://github.com/mhoye/gitcoach) ([on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gitcoach))

I have contributed to the following open source projects:

* [Drupal](http://drupal.org)
* [Phergie](http://github.com/phergie/phergie)
* [redmine_google_docs](http://github.com/evolvingweb/redmine_google_docs)
