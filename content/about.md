## The basics

Hello! I'm Tavish.
I come from [Aurora, Ontario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Ontario), a town near Toronto.
Between 2008 and 2014 I lived in Montreal where I studied software engineering at Concordia University.
Since June 2014 I've lived in San Francisco where I work at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).
I've also lived briefly in Montauban, France and enjoy speaking broken french to anyone who will listen.

## Things that I do

Recently I edited [The Performance of Open Source
Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html), a collection of case studies
on software performance. The goal was to do for performance what [The
Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)
did for architecture.

I maintain or co-maintain the following projects:

* [nbdiff](http://github.com/tarmstrong/nbdiff) ([on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nbdiff))

* [gitcoach](http://github.com/mhoye/gitcoach) ([on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gitcoach))
