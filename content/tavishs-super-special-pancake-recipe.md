-   2 cups white flour
-   1 cup whole wheat flour
-   1 cup rye flour
-   3 tablespoons sugar
-   4 tablespoons butter
-   4 eggs, beaten
-   a bunch of milk (\~3 cups)

Directions:

1.  Mix dry ingredients.
2.  Beat eggs.
3.  Melt butter.
4.  Mix wet ingredients.
5.  Mix all ingredients.
6.  Fry on a buttered pan on low heat.
7.  Eat.

Optionally put the mix in a squirt bottle so you can make pancakes in
the shape of an octopus or whatever.

You may not find this recipe sweet enough. You can get away with putting
twice as much sugar in.
