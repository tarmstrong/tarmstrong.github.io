      <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;1848: Year of Revolution&lt;/em&gt; by Mike Rapport:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed with which the wave of revolutions swept across Europe was
due to the wonders of modern technology. In 1789 it took weeks for
news – carried, at its fastest, on horseback or under sail – for the
fall of the Bastille to be relayed across Central and Eastern Europe.
In 1848, thanks to steamships and a nascent telegraph system, reports
were being heard within days or even minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
