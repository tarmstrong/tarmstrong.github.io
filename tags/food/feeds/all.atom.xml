      <title>George Orwell likes tea</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this essay by George Orwell on tea:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.booksatoz.com/witsend/tea/orwell.htm&#34; title=&#34;George Orwell: A Nice Cup of Tea&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.
He attacks the subject with as much force as anything he&amp;rsquo;s written. What
struck me, in particular, was how much he enjoyed writing it. It&amp;rsquo;s
obvious, even in his reserved tone. This is something Zinsser talks
about often, and I&amp;rsquo;m noticing it often in the writers I enjoy reading,
speakers I enjoy listening to, and teachers I enjoy learning from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orwell seems to think milk is a necessary ingredient in a nice cup of
tea. I disagree, for the same reason he disagrees with people who like
sugar in their tea. It tarnishes the drink, and I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine feeling
&amp;ldquo;wiser, braver, or more optimistic&amp;rdquo; after drinking a milky tea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Making your own yogurt is like growing your own vegetables, but it
happens overnight. The yogurt you get out of it is delicate, cheap, and
way better than that gelatinous stuff you get in the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one: Heat your milk to 80 C. Heat it in a double boiler like this,
so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t burn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/cheeseplusplus/5173831750/&#34; title=&#34;Making yogurt: heat the milk by cheese++, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/5173831750_2eef15ccff_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Making yogurt: heat the
milk&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step two: Cool the milk. Do this by putting your yogurt vessel into a
sink full of cold water. Do this so the milk is the right temperature
(40 C) for the yogurt bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/cheeseplusplus/5173226829/&#34; title=&#34;Making yogurt: cooling the milk by cheese++, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5173226829_2bca238fec_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Making yogurt: cooling the
milk&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step three: Add your starter yogurt. You can just dump it in, or whisk
it in. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step four: leave on a heating pad overnight. Keep the innoculated milk
at around 35 C for 7-12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/cheeseplusplus/5173831796/&#34; title=&#34;Making yogurt: growing the yogurt by cheese++, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5173831796_08a00308cd_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Making yogurt: growing the
yogurt&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, stir the thickened yogurt into the greenish whey that
will be floating on top. Put your finished, but warm, yogurt into the
fridge and let it cool. It will be ready to eat after a few hours. After
a few days it will be noticeably thicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, you&amp;rsquo;ve done it. All-natural, tasty yogurt. You&amp;rsquo;ve made cows
everywhere proud.&lt;/p&gt;
