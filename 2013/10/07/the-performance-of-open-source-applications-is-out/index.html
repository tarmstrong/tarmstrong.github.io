        <h1>The Performance of Open Source Applications is out!</h1>
        <h6>Mon 07 Oct 2013 08:00:00</h6>
        <p>I&rsquo;m happy to announce that <em>The Performance of Open Source Applications</em> is
finally out. You can head over to <a href="http://aosabook.org">the AOSA website</a> to
read it for free online and find links to places where you can purchase paper
or, soon, electronic copies.</p>

<p>If you do purchase it, the royalties go to Amnesty International.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about what the book is about, the
<a href="http://aosabook.org/en/posa/introduction.html">introduction</a> is a good place
to start. The authors worked hard to share what they know and I learned a lot
from them; I hope you do too.</p>
