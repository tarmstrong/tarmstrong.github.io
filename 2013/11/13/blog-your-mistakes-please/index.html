        <h1>Blog your mistakes, please</h1>
        <h6>Wed 13 Nov 2013 00:23:00</h6>
        <p>Earlier this week I read a neat post by Sarah Mei called <a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/">Why You Should Never
Use MongoDB</a>. Usually I would skip a blog post with that title, but
for some reason I stuck with it, and I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>

<p>I usually don&rsquo;t like titles like &ldquo;why you should never use MongoDB&rdquo; because the
author usually means &ldquo;why you shouldn&rsquo;t use MongoDB if you are me and you are
using it in the specific way I am using it and you are in the specific business
that I work for.&rdquo; The author writes the snappy title because it looks good on
the Hacker News front page.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t that kind of blog post, though, and she makes a compelling argument
that almost earns the title.</p>

<p>The title <em>should</em> be &ldquo;Why <em>You</em> Should Never Use MongoDB&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m being pedantic,
but I think the emphasis makes the point clearer. The post is making an
assumption about you, and that assumption is this: you are not as smart as she
is and if you are not as smart as she is, how can you hope to avoid the problem
she is describing? I am not as smart as she is, so I&rsquo;m going to learn from her
mistake.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an inexperienced software developer; a n00b. I haven&rsquo;t watched a large
software system go from infancy to smouldering ruins, nor have I watched design
decisions explode in my face nine months after making them. And how could I
have? I&rsquo;m an undergraduate student and there aren&rsquo;t enough months of summer
jobs to string together to create those experiences.</p>

<p>Since I don&rsquo;t have many of these experiences of my own, I&rsquo;m forced to use the
experiences of others. Let&rsquo;s call these <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/index.html"><em>prosthetic experiences</em></a>.
Brave, humble, smart folks like Sarah Mei, who can talk about the projects
they&rsquo;ve seen crash and burn, are a boon; prosthetic experiences can help me
think about design tradeoffs in ways I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be able to without
dealing with those problems myself.  They help me develop paranoia in the right
places. Hopefully, it&rsquo;ll help me avoid boring mistakes and make more
interesting messes instead.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not fun to write about your mistakes. But I like it when you do.</p>
