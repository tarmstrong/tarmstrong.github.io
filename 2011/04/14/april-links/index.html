        <p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/03/29/1018033108">Hungry judges are
ruthless</a>. This
study finds that judges will not grant parole right before breaks or
meals, or when they are tired. Assuming some pre-lunch cases deserved a
favourable ruling (i.e. the judges were indeed being too heavy-handed
with their pre-lunch cases), this suggests that you should <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/58y/the_bias_you_didnt_expect/">avoid making
difficult decisions when you are
hungry</a>.</p>

<p>Charlie Stross
<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/04/you-probably-already-saw-this-.html">predicts</a>
that SpaceX could put a man on the moon by 2016 for \$1 Billion USD.</p>

<p><a href="http://fakescience.tumblr.com/">Fake Science</a> is so amusing that I
think some dopamines leaked out of my ear. (Thanks Helen!)</p>

<p><a href="http://maycontaindragons.blogspot.com/2011/03/few-d-things-and-happy-birthday-to.html">Simon paints awesome
stuff</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://cultureisnotyourfriend.bandcamp.com/">Lachlan is saving Japan with his drone
friends</a>. His bass is like
an earthquake that helps Japan instead of destroying it.</p>

<p><a href="http://cjlo.com/news/concordia/your-concordia-and-action-disqualified-csu-elections">Concordia&rsquo;s undergraduate student union is
ridiculous</a>.
After a decent party finally got voted in, the guy in charge of
elections, Oliver Cohen, decides both parties broke the rules, and thus
we need to have a another election. <a href="http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2011/04/14/concordia-student-elecitons-chief-throws-out-vote-results/">The party that got voted in is not
allowed to run again for two
years.</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I forgot: if you&rsquo;re a software engineering student at
Concordia, you can now plan your class schedule with the
<a href="http://wolfdragon.org">WolfDragonScheduler</a>.</p>
