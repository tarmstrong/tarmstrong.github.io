        <p>From <em>1848: Year of Revolution</em> by Mike Rapport:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The speed with which the wave of revolutions swept across Europe was
due to the wonders of modern technology. In 1789 it took weeks for
news – carried, at its fastest, on horseback or under sail – for the
fall of the Bastille to be relayed across Central and Eastern Europe.
In 1848, thanks to steamships and a nascent telegraph system, reports
were being heard within days or even minutes.</p>
