        <p>I just made a browser-based writing program that lets you write without
editing. Every time you hit return, it formats the paragraph you just
wrote. You can&rsquo;t go back and edit that paragraph. Editing is for people
who have completed stories.</p>

<p>Download it here:
<a href="https://github.com/tarmstrong/write_pretty_story/zipball/master">.zip</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/tarmstrong/write_pretty_story/tarball/master">.tar.gz</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/tarmstrong/write_pretty_story">github.com</a>.</p>

<p>To run it, open the &ldquo;pretty.html&rdquo; file with your browser.</p>

<p>You can also try it
<a href="http://tavisharmstrong.com/pretty/pretty.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Now it saves your story locally, so when you refresh the
page it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
