        <p>CUSEC 2011 was my second time at the Canadian University Software
Engineering Conference. I felt less lost this time around, and it was a
good time. We saw some good talks, spoke to some cool people, and
skipped a lot of class.</p>

<p>Some highlights (my top 3):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.drewconway.com/Drew_Conway/About.html">Drew Conway</a>
spoke about terrorism and drug networks, and how to visualize them
using R (a language that specializes in visualizing data). The
biggest takeaway was that domain expertise + code = awesome cool
stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://topologicalmedialab.net/xinwei/">Sha Xin Wei</a> spoke about
the Topological Media Lab at Concordia. It was refreshing to see a
talk like that at a tech conference; it wouldn&rsquo;t have been out of
place at an art conference, but it also wasn&rsquo;t out of place at
CUSEC. I like using code to do art, so it was a pretty inspiring
talk.</li>
<li>Mike Shaver spoke about managing the Mozilla team. This guy is the
one of the smartest people I&rsquo;ve ever heard speak. He gave amazing
answers to difficult questions, and answered even Linus
Torvalds-grade flames with calm balance. You couldn&rsquo;t even get him
to say incendiary stuff about Internet Explorer, which just blew my
mind.<br />
Mike began his talk by speaking briefly about how he is bi-polar.
People don&rsquo;t understand problems of mental health very well, he
says, and we need to be able to talk about it more openly. I admire
his courage and ability to speak about it in front of a crowd of
possibly immature students. Here is <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/">Mike Shaver&rsquo;s
blog</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Great conference. I look forward to a new year of hackery. I made the
same resolution last year, but my new resolution is to get something
impressive ready to demo at CUSEC next year.</p>
