        <h1>Check out my talk at D4D Boston 2011!</h1>
        <h6>Wed 03 Aug 2011 03:14:00</h6>
        <p>In July I went to <a href="http://boston2011.design4drupal.org/">D4D Boston
2011</a>, a Drupal conference with a
focus on design. Even so, I was given the chance to do my talk on Drupal
7&rsquo;s Field API. To my surprise, I had an audience of around fifty to talk
to (or it at least felt like fifty).</p>

<p>The talk was based on blog post I wrote for Evolving Web about <a href="http://evolvingweb.ca/story/poutine-maker-introduction-field-api-drupal-7-part-1">Poutine
Maker</a>,
my custom Drupal field that lets users design crazy poutines. (You can
see the formatter in action
<a href="http://poutinemaker.evolvingweb.ca/node/1">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Overall, it was a fantastic experience. I&rsquo;m a little shy at conferences,
so it was nice to meet people after who had seen my talk (even the guy
who kept calling me Tarvis).</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m totally going to <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/">DrupalCon
London</a> at the end of the month, which
I&rsquo;m super jazzed about. Co-op jobs aren&rsquo;t supposed to be like this, but
I am <em>definitely not complaining</em>.</p>

<p>(By the way, if you want to work with me and the cool people I work
with, <a href="http://evolvingweb.ca/web-developer">Evolving Web is hiring</a>.)</p>
